Welcome to AQMLator's documentation!
====================================
Machine learning (ML) has reshaped the landscape of applied computer science
by enabling algorithms to self-adapt based on data. Equally transformative,
quantum computing (QC) has opened new horizons by addressing computationally
challenging problems through quantum mechanics. While both fields have
individually shown immense potential, their convergence promises unprecedented
capabilities. Enter AQMLator - the (A)uto (Q)uantum (M)achine (L)earning
platform. Designed for data scientists, both seasoned in quantum computing and
newcomers alike, AQMLator simplifies the integration of quantum machine learning
(QML) into your workflows. Without the necessity of deep quantum expertise,
users can leverage AQMLator to determine the best-fit QML models for their data
and even incorporate the proposed variational quantum circuits as adaptable
layers in hybrid models.
